# PlantBuddy

This application is dedicated to the plant lovers out there who have a very busy schedule and sometimes they forget to take care of their plant friends. It can also be helpful for those who have no knowledge about plants and want to keep record about how and when to take care of their new plant friend in order not to kill them (by accident of course).

It will have the following features:

I.	Must have:

    •	Create an account.

    •	Add your flowers into the app – specify what type of plant you have, if it lives indoors/outdoors, how often do you need to water it, default temperature, preferred time interval for watering, sun exposure.

    •	Reminder – it reminds you to water your plants based on the temperature of the recent time and sun exposure. If the plants are outside, the watering time may change depending on the temperature since the last time it was watered. If the plant is inside, the temperature is considered default and the watering interval won’t be affected.

II.	Nice to have:

    •	Interval for watering to be affected not only by temperature but also by humidity and wind.

    •	Have some predefined most popular plants already known by the app and also recommended watering frequency and default temperature.

    •	Forum for Q&A.
